          <h2>Longterm careers goals</h2>

          <p> My long term career goal I would like to gain enough skills and knowledge to be able to choose the work I would like to do. 
              I came into this course thinking that I want to get into blockchain technology but I feel that I might be more suited to the design side. 
              In the long term, I would like to work remotely from anywhere. Anything to do with music or cryptocurrency-related are my interest.</p>
          
          <h2>
              Strengths and Limitations</h2>
              My strengths are that I pay attention to detail but that sometimes causes me to get very distracted,
              going down a few rabbit holes. When I am interested in something I got all in.  
              <p>

          <h2>Skills to develop</h2> 
              <p> 
              The skill I would like to develop is my time structuring. I am not that good at keeping time as 
              I pay attention to detail and end up spending too much time on a topic. When I get a bit overwhelmed 
              under pressure I would like to learn how to not spend too much time over researching. 
              </p> 
          
          <h2>Managing workload</h2>
              <p> 
              Its have been pretty tough learning something completely different from what I have done before.
              Managing the workload and trying to get it all at the same time. I will reach out to other learners if I 
              am stuck and couldn’t find the solution online. If all else fails to resolve the problem I will reach out 
              to a facilitator. I will work in half-hour slots and have 10min breaks in between. In those breaks, I will 
              get outside and/or do some exercise. If things get to me I will break down the task into smaller pieces and 
              if I still feel overwhelmed I will walk away and take a breather. I might know the answer coming back to it. 
              I have personal connections and a partner where I can seek help if I am stuck. If they can’t help me then I 
              will reach out to my cohort or facilitator. I do have to get over feeling embarrassed to ask for help from other 
              students. I will put my ego aside and ask for help.
              </p>
             
  
          <h2>What I expect from my facilitators</h2>
              
              <p>
              I would expect the team to communicate clearly what work is 
              needed for the next sprint. They will guide me in the right direction if I approach them when I am stuck. They 
              understand that everyone is not on the same level of understanding and help people to the lever of their knowledge. 
              Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might 
              have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in. My partner has two daughters and we 
              have breakfast together in the morning and will potentially help with school drop off when we get back to level 3. 
              For now its quite relaxed. 
              </p>
          
          <h2>Working time slots</h2>
              <p>
              I will try keep the morning free and start around 9am-12pm, 12.30pm - 5pm, 7.30pm - 9.30pm 
              Mon to Fri. Sat and Sunday I will use to catch up with any work and prepare for the following Sprint.
