        <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
        <h3>By Jacobus Engelbrecht</h3>
        <h3>29 September 2021</h3>
        <h2>What is the problem?</h2>
        <p>
            <p>The first stage of the 5 step problem solving model</p>
            <p>1. Define exactly what the problem is.</p>
            <p>
                Be clear and specific as to what exactly the problem is, when it happens, how often, what effect is it, what is the deviation from standard? See Problem statement for more information.</p>
            <p>2. What is my plan?</p>
            <p>
                Think of at least 2 or 3 possible methods that you might use to identify what went wrong. In other words, where and what do you need to investigate to help determine the cause. A strategy is a way or method or process for understanding the root causes.
            <p>3. What might happen if?</p>
            <p>
                Examine your list of possible strategies from section 2, and choose the one that seems to fit best for the problem at hand.
            <p>4. Try it out!</p>
            <p>
                Work the strategy, which you chose in step 3 and determine whether your team found the cause. If you did, then move onto the next step.
            </p>
            <p>5. Measure</p>
            <p>
                Measure the process outputs, and if the problem has gone, you are done!
            <p>If your best strategy doesn’t work, go back to your list of possible strategies in Step Two and choose another. Keep passing through the steps until your measurements tell you the problem has gone.
        </p>
        <h2>Some problem solving techniques that I use</h2>
        <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
        <p>
            Pseudocode is an artificial and informal language that helps programmers develop algorithms. 
        </p>
        <h2>Trying something</h2>
        <p>
            The fastest way to learning in my opinion is to just try it. If it doesn’t work, then try something else. With this process, you can rule out the things you have tried but didn’t work. Eventually, you will come across a solution that does work. 
        </p>
        <h2>Ruber ducky method</h2>
        <p>
            In software engineering, rubber duck debugging is a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck.
        </p>

        <h2>Reading error messages</h2>
        <p>
           The good news is that we all have the ability to learn and change, by rewiring our brains. If you change a bad habit or think about something differently,
           you can carve a new pathway. For this to be most efficient, a repetitive pattern is necessary. Think of your brain as a muscle and the more you work it out, 
           the stronger it will get. 
        </p>
        <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
        <p>
            Reading error messages sometimes has the answers for you. We usually think an error message tells you that you are wrong but actually if you look and pay attention, you might find the solution in the error message. 
        </p>
        <h2>Console.logging</h2>
        <p>
            This method is very useful if you want to see the changes you have made LIVE and you can go through problem solving if there are any eros that come up in the console. 
        </p>
        <h2>Googling</h2>
        <p>
            Google is probably the biggest help when it comes to not knowing how to do something. Anything you need to know at the push of some buttons. What a time to be alive. 
        </p>
        <img src="/images-folder/google.jpg" alt="google">
        <h2>Asking for peers to help</h2>
        <p>
            This is a very useful resource if you have tried all of the above and still can’t resolve the problem. Your peers might have seen something or know something that you have missed. You might be making a bigger problem than it actually is.
             Like the famous quote goes..

        <q>We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.” - Albert Einstein</q>
