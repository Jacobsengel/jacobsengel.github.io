        <h1>What is EQ and why could it be more important than IQ to find that dream job</h1>
        <h2></h2>
        <h3>By Jacobus Engelbrecht</h3>
        
        <h2>What is EQ?</h2>
        
        <p>
            Emotional Intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) was coined by Peter Salovey and John D. Mayer in the 1990’s describing it as 
            “a form of social intelligence that involves the ability to monitor one’s own and others’ feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them, 
            and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and action”. Basically, if you can regulate your own emotions, read and perceive others 
            emotions with empathy and use this collected emotional data to be able to communicate and relate effectively with the world around you, then 
            there’s a good chance that you are highly emotionally intelligent! 
            <br>
            Does this sound like you? Here are the signs to look out for:
        </p> 
            <ul>
                <li>Identifying emotions</li>
                <li>evaluating how others feel</li>
                <li>Controliing one's own emotions</li>
                <li>Percieving how others feel</li>
                <li>Using emotions to facilitate social communication</li>
                <li>Relating to others</li>
                <br>
            </ul>
       
        <p>
            <h2>How is it different from IQ?</h2>
        </p>
            The intelligence quotient, also known as IQ, is a measure of your ability to reason and solve problems with that score that tells you how far above or 
            below one sits in peer groups. On the original IQ tests, scores were calculated by dividing the individual's mental age by their chronological age and 
            then multiplying that number by 100. Today, there are many online tests that will take you through a variety of tests measuring your knowledge of languages 
            and mathematics, including how quickly it takes you to process. 
            <br>
            Here is what IQ tests look for:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Visual and spatial processing</li>
                <li>knowledge of the world</li>
                <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
                <li>Working memory and short term memory</li>
                <li>Quantitative reasoning
            </ul>
            <h2>Why is EQ so important?</h2>
        <p>
            As much as a society that values intellect and linear thinking over all else would have you believe, IQ is not the only form to measure how “smart” 
            someone is.
            <br>
            Being able to spout the knowledge of the world and understanding mathematical formulas is great, but our daily interactions are not all numbers and facts. 
            In our day to day lives, we are dealing with humans, which by nature are emotional-energetic beings. Take a business scenario. Yes, it’s good to have the 
            facts and figures worked out so you know if you’re in profit and how many people are buying your products, but if we don’t know why they brought our products
             or if we don’t know how to engage and motivate our staff then those numbers would be a waste of time. 
            <br>
            Research has found that individuals with strong leadership potential also tend to be more emotionally intelligent, suggesting that a high EQ is an important 
            quality for business leaders and managers.
            <br>
            While both IQ and EI can grow and change over time, EI is more welcoming of the fact that people can learn, develop and train themselves to increase their 
            emotional intelligence score
            <br>
            Below is a pyramid that shows the cognitive and metacognitive processes to move from a layer to another. In other words, you start from the bottom and work 
            your way up.  What are you feeling and what made you feel this way. Working your way up the layers. The goal is to get too emotional unity.
