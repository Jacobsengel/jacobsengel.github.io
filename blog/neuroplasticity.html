        <h1>Neuroplasticity and a Growth Mindset</h1>
        <h3>By Jacobus Engelbrecht</h3>

        <h2>What is Neuroplasticity?</h2>

        <p>
          Inside each and every one of us is a beautiful symphony. A hundred billion neurons firing in concert constructing this vivid reality 
          we are living in. An in each little piece of that neural activity lies a little bit of what makes you, you. After you experience today, 
          that activity would have shifted and you will never be the same again. You are inextricably tied to your brain. Imagine the possibilities 
          if we could have control over how our brains shape our reality. Well, we can.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity, also known as neural plasticity, or brain plasticity, is the ability of neural networks in the brain to change through growth 
          and reorganization. Not so long ago scientists believed that our brains did not change after childhood and that it was hardwired and fixed by the
          time we become adults. Recent advances in the last decade have proven that this is simply not true and we can absolutely train our brains. The brain 
          can and does change throughout our lives. It is adaptable, like plastic. Hence neuroscientists call this Neuroplasticity. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>How does Neuroplasticity? Work?</h2>
        <p>
          Think of it as a dynamic, connected power grid. There are billions of pathways, or roads, lighting up every time you think feel or do something. 
          Some of these roads are well travelled, these are our habits. Our established ways of thinking feeling or doing. Every time we think a certain way, 
          do a particular task or feel a specific emotion, we strengthen this road. It becomes easier for our brains to travel this pathway. Say we start thinking 
          and feeling about something differently, we then start carving out a new road. If we keep travelling that road, our brains begin to use this pathway more.
          This way of thinking, feeling, or doing becomes second nature. The old pathway gets used less and weakens. This process of rewiring your brain by forming 
          new connections and weakening old ones is Neuroplasticity in action.
        </p>
        <p>
          The good news is that we all have the ability to learn and change, by rewiring our brains. If you change a bad habit or think about something differently,
           you can carve a new pathway. For this to be most efficient, a repetitive pattern is necessary. Think of your brain as a muscle and the more you work it out, 
           the stronger it will get. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>What is the difference between a Fixed and a Growth mindset?</h2>
        <p>
          There are two different types of people with two different mindsets. Someone with a fixed mindset leads to desire to look smart and therefore a tendency to avoid
           challenges, give up easily, see effort as fruitless or worse, ignore useful negative feedback and feel threatened by the success of others. A growth mindset leads 
           to a desire to learn and therefore a tendency to embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, sees effort as the path to mastery, learn from criticism, find 
           lessons and inspiration in the success of others.

          , studies human motivation. She spends her days diving into why people succeed (or don’t) and what’s within our control to foster success. Her theory of the two mindsets and the difference they 
          make in outcomes is incredibly powerful.

            Your view of yourself can determine everything. If you believe that your qualities are unchangeable — the fixed mindset — you will want to prove yourself correct over and over rather than 
            learning from your mistakes.

            In Mindset, Dweck writes:
        <p>
            "If you have only a certain amount of intelligence, a certain personality, and a certain moral character— well, then you’d better prove that you have a healthy dose of them. It simply wouldn’t
            do to look or feel deficient in these most basic characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
            […]
        </p>
            I’ve seen so many people with this one consuming goal of proving themselves— in the classroom, in their careers, and in their relationships. Every situation calls for a confirmation of their 
            intelligence, personality, or character. Every situation is evaluated: Will I succeed or fail? Will I look smart or dumb? Will I be accepted or rejected? Will I feel like a winner or a loser?
            These things are culturally desirable. We value intelligence, personality, and character. It’s normal to want this. But …

        </p>

        <p>
            In Mindset, Dweck writes:
        <p>
            There’s another mindset in which these traits are not simply a hand you’re dealt and have to live with, always trying to convince yourself and others that you have a royal flush when you’re 
            secretly worried it’s a pair of tens. In this mindset, the hand you’re dealt is just the starting point for development. This growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities 
            are things you can cultivate through your efforts.
        </p> 
            Changing our beliefs can have a powerful impact. The growth mindset creates a powerful passion for learning. “Why waste time proving over and over how great you are,” Dweck writes, “when you 
            could be getting better?”
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>Power of … Yet</h2> 
        <p>
            In this TED talk, Dweck describes “two ways to think about a problem that’s slightly too hard for you to solve.” Operating in this space,  just outside of your comfort zone, is the key to 
            improving your performance. It’s also the critical element to deliberate practice. People approach these problems with the two mindsets… “Are you not smart enough to solve it …. or have you 
            just not solved it yet.”
