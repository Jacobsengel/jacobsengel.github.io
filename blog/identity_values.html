        <h1>Identity, values and Strengths</h1>
        <h2>Personal core values</h2>
        <p>
            There are so many values but if I had to choose. In no particular order, some of my core values are, 
            communication is very important and I’m not just talking about talking but also listening and being 
            present. It’s easy to get distracted. That brings me to my next personal value, trust. If communication 
            is unclear then that could lead to distrust. In order to have trust, you need respect from another. This 
            usually gets built over time. If communication is very clear from the start then this usually happens quite 
            quickly. 
        </p> 
        <p>
            I am a believer in community. We are so much stronger as a community and can do much more if we collaborate
             together. Everyone brings a unique set of skills and knowledge forward, whatever their experience is. 
             Communication and trust play a big part in building a strong community. Community is all bout being 
             inclusive and 
        </p>
            Another core value of mine would be growth. Learning, experiencing and making mistakes. As frustrating as 
            it can be sometimes. The growth takes place when you have to decide how you react under pressure or when 
            you feeling overwhelmed. That is where growth takes place. Even if you react in a way and have regrets 
            later. You will know for next time how you want to grow from it. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Last but not least, family and friends. Its so easy to grow apart and get too busy. When groth takes place 
            you will lose some friends but more importantly gain new ones, that share similat interests. 
        </p>
